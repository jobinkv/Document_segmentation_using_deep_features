# Document_segmentation_using_deep_features
The paper presents a document image segmentation
method based on the features extracted from a pre-trained
deep convolutional neural network (CNN). The document image
segmentation problem is considered as a pixel labeling problem
where each pixel in a document image classified into one of the
predefined labels such as text, comments, decorations and background.
We extract deep features from superpixels of a document
image, learn an SVM classifier using these features and segment
the document image. Fisher vector encoded convolutional layer
features (FV-CNN) and fully connected layer features (FC-CNN)
are used in our experiments. Experiments demonstrate that our
approach gives better results for segmenting document images
compared to the state-of-art approaches on popular handwritten
dataset with both types of features.
